Report summary

Our dataset has information on almost 4700+ Houses/Apartments/Flats Available for Rent in India. We have explored how some important features like releasing time, size, location, and number of rooms will influence the rental. The results show that rent price of a property is affected by multiple factors, and some of the relationships are more complex than linear.
